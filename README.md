# Pharmacy-Desktop-App
Java

The concept of the app is to help medical staff to order drugs in a simple, fast, comfortable way.

Technologies: Java library like Java SE, Java Swing, Java Persistence API, Hibernate and using MySQL for database,
and for UML diagrams (Use-Case Diagram, Class Driagram, Sequence Diagrams, Communication Diagrams) I used Star UML.
